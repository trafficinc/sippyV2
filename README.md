# sippy
  Sippy is a small/easy to use modern PHP web development Framework.

Work in progress, but feel free to:
- download zip to web directory or git clone
- run composer
- point your browser to [http://localhost/sippy/public]

TODO's:
- [BaseController] Add request controller validation
- Authentication component
- Front-End: add build tools (JS libraries - [jQuery,Vue], SASS)
- Email service
- Add to CLI, ability to create and manage Sippy components
- Development/Testing Tools

## CLI Tools

$ php cli/sippy.php -help

More coming soon.
This framework is geared toward smaller applications or brochure web projects.

_Sippy dependencies are Twig (view templating) and Illuminate/Database (Eloquent ORM)_

__Need PHP 7.0+, MySQL 5.6+__ (may work on lower versions, haven't tested them though)

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to Sippy, my aim is to keep Sippy small and easy to use.
