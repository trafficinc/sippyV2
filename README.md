# sippy
Sippy is a small/easy to use modern PHP web development Framework.

Work in progress, but feel free to download, run composer, and point the browser to localhost:<port>/sippy/public.

Need some help with features and documentation.
Trying to keep this framework geared toward smaller applications or brochure web projects.
